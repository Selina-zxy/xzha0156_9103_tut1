# Week 8 Assignment
## Part 1
The two photos that inspir me  for my assignment come from *Citizen Kane*. I am particularly moved by the use of light and shadow to express emotion and spatial relationships. The characters' face in shadow, emphasizing both their physical and emotional distance. This technique not only creates visual depth but also conveys a deeper narrative. I aim to incorporate these spatial dynamics into my project, using light to shape relationships between elements and add layers of meaning, enhancing both composition and storytell.
## Part 2
I find three coding techniques that could assist in implementing the imaging technique I selected in Part 1 of this quiz. I'm here mainly dicuss Orbit Control.
### Orbit Control
Orbit control allow users to adjust the camera direction in 3D rendering using mouse or touchscreen inputs. By dragging, scrolling, or pinching, the camera can rotate, pan, or zoom, adding realism and depth to a scene. Moving or rotating the camera offers different perspectives, and adding light sources with adjustable intensity creates shadows, further enhancing the sence of space.
